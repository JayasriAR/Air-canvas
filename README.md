# Aircanvas
Draw in air by just waving your hands
Introducing a drawing application in air that uses hand gestures to draw or sketch on the
canvas in real time. Hand gesture-based painting can be implemented by using a camera to
capture hand movements. An intangible interface is created and implemented using real-time
visual dynamic hand gestures to perform activities such as tool selection, canvas writing, and
canvas clearing. Images of the hand are captured by the systemâ€™s webcam and processed in real-
time using a single-shot detection model and media lines, allowing the machine to communicate with the user in a split second.
